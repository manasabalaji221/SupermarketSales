For this web application, I have used the Supermarket Sales Dataset from Kaggle. It has a list of invoices created at a supermarket and itâ€™s details. There are 17 attributes in this dataset and around 1000 values. The attributes are [Invoice ID], Branch, City, [Customer type], Gender, [Product line], [Unit price], Quantity, [Tax 5%], Total, Date, Time, Payment, cogs, [gross margin percentage], [gross income] and Rating. 

The application is built on a Python Flask application with the front end being HTML, CSS. I hosted this application on Microsoft Azure App Service. The database server used was an SQL server and the database was the SQL database on Azure. 

I implemented the given problems in 4 questions. 
1.	Fetch required data from the database.
Used a form for the user to enter a date and it return all the transactions that took place on that particular date.

2.	Record a sale
This uses a form to allow the user to manually enter the details of a sale that occurred. The total, tax, GMP, GI, etc is calculated and would display a message once the invoice has been entered into the database.

3.	Change the type of Customer (Member/Normal)
Here, we can change the type of user from member to normal or vice versa.

4.	Analysis of data
The different categories and their impact on the sales is reflected using charts.
